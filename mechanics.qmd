This class will be conducted in person, but all course materials will be available online.
It follows a [flipped classroom](#flipped-classroom) and [active learning](#active-learning) approach, which means that students will learn the content outside of class and engage in assignments during class.

## Flipped Classroom

The flipped classroom is an educational approach where **students learn the instructional content outside of class** (e.g., through videos or online resources) and **use class time for interactive activities**, discussions, and collaboration.
In this course, students will learn at home using the available online resources.
Class time is protected time for implementation.

### Course Materials

TBA

## Active Learning

Active learning in this class involves engaging in **hands-on coding activities during class time**.
Research on active learning indicates that this approach promotes a greater understanding and retention of the material compared to passive teaching methods [e.g., @deslauriers2019].

## Implementation

> "*For training to have an impact, students must implement what they've 
learned in their own research.*"
[@weissgerber2023]

@heise2023 outline actions that course organizers can take to prepare and support course participants in implementing what they have learned once they return to their research environment.

On [this page](implementation.qmd) we consider how to apply the recommendations by @heise2023 to our course in detail.
