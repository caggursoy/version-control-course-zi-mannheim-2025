## Important note: Git repository in `/user` folder?

::: {.fragment}
- Please make sure that your `{{< var course.project >}}` folder is in a suitable place (for example, in the `Desktop`, `Documents` folders or where you keep your course-related files, ...) and **not** in your user directory!
- You can check your current working directory by running `pwd` in your `{{< var course.project >}}` folder.
- Also: Always remember to `cd` into your repository before you execute Git commands!
- If your `{{< var course.project >}}` folder is in your user directory, please **tell us** and we can fix it.

::: {.fragment}
**Tip:** To prevent ever creating a Git repository inside your `user` folder, you can use:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{zsh filename="Code"}
touch ~/.git
```
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}

Running `git init` in the `user` directory now results in a (desired) error:

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{zsh filename="Output"}
fatal: invalid gitfile format: /Users/user/.git
```
