## Email

Dear course participants,

You are receiving this email because you have signed up for the course "{{< var project.title >}}", taking place {{< var project.when-long >}} at the {{< var project.where-institution >}} ({{< var project.where-room >}}), {{< var project.where-address >}}.
We are excited that you have signed up for this course and can't wait to delve into the world of version control with you.

In preparation for the course, we kindly ask you to **complete two small assignments**: (1) check if you have Git installed, (2) answer a short survey.
In total, this should **only take about 15 minutes** (not much longer).

**1. Check Git installation**

Please check if you have Git installed.
You can find detailed instructions in our course book here: <https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/installation.html>.
Windows users: Please install Git for Windows (<https://gitforwindows.org>).
macOS and Linux users: You likely have Git already installed.
Open a terminal / command line and enter `git --version`.
If a version number is shown, Git is installed. 
For more details, see the link to the course book above.
And please don't forget to bring your laptop, with Git installed, to the course!

**2. Complete short survey** 

In order to tailor the course to your prior experience and needs, we have prepared a **short survey** with a few questions.
Please **complete the survey before the course**, ideally **by Wednesday evening** (June 19th 2024).
This will give us enough time to review your responses before our course on Friday.

The survey can be accessed here: **https://version-control-intro.formr.org**

A few technical remarks about the survey:
The survey will ask you for two codewords: a **personal codeword** and a **course codeword**.

The **personal codeword** is used to associate your responses with a unique identifier.
This will allow us to identify and relate your responses across all surveys used in the course while ensuring anonymity.
By providing a personal codeword, you will allow us to draw more detailed insights from your responses that will help me improve the course for you.
The survey will contain an explanation of how to generate your personal codeword.

The **course codeword** is used to tag your responses as coming from a course participant at {{< var project.where-institution >}}.
We might also use the survey to collect responses from participants in other course settings.
The course codeword allows us to distinguish responses from different course settings.

**The course codeword is: `--------`** (course password will be announced during the course).

Further information about the course can be found on our course website: [{{< var links.site >}}]({{< var links.site >}}).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us directly via email.

We are looking forward to seeing you at the course on Friday!

Best wishes,

Lennart Wittkuhn (Instructor) and the organizing team
