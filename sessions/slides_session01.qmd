::: {.notes}
- we heard a lot about artificial intelligence
- what does "intelligence" even mean?
- as psychologists & cognitive neuroscientists we are interested in understanding human "natural" or biological intelligence
- our group: intersted in the convergence between neuroscience and artifiicial intelligence research ("neuro AI")
- e.g., "why are humans so fast in learning a wide range of tasks in complex environments"
- we use cogntive and psychological approaches, neural measurmenet using fMRI and EEG and integrate and compare them with computational approaches from reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks

## Computational Reproducibility

*"... when the **same analysis** steps performed on the **same dataset** consistently produce the **same answer**."* ^[@turingway2022, see ["Guide on Reproducible Research"](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions)]

:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
### The problem
:::
::: {.incremental}
- about **more than half** of research is **not reproducible** [^1]
  - research data, code, software and materials are **often not available** "upon *reasonable* [sic] request"
  - if resources are shared, they are **often incomplete**
- 90% of researchers: "reproducibility crisis" (*N* = 1576) ^[see @baker2016, *Nature*]

:::
::: {.fragment}
### Why?
:::
::: {.incremental}
- computational reproducibility is hard
- researchers lack training 
- incentives are not (yet) aligned ^[see e.g., @poldrack2019]
- "natural selection of bad science" ^[see @smaldino2016]
:::

:::::

::: {.fragment}
"*... accumulated evidence indicates that there is **substantial room for improvement** with regard to research practices to maximize the efficiency of the research community's use of the public's financial investment.*" [@munafò2017]
:::
::: {.fragment}
We need a **professional toolkit** for digital scientific outputs!
:::

[^1]: for example, in Psychology: @crüwell2023; @hardwicke2021; @obels2020; @wicherts2006


::: {.notes}
- also called "analytical reproducibility"
- in contrast: "Replication" = same analysis on different data
- computational reproducibility should be a *minimum* requirement
- 90% of respondents to a survey in Nature agreed that there is a "reproducibility crisis"
- non-scientist friends react very surprised at the lack of professionalization in science
- we are currently violating the public's trust = deep ethical problem
- natural selection: as a researcher, what's good for your career is not necessarily good for science (how to get funding, how to get published, how to get cited)
- journals are interested in selling us back our data, not improving the quality of science

## What is version control

::: {.fragment}
*"Version control is a systematic approach to record changes made in a [...] set of files, over time. This allows you and your collaborators to track the history, see what changed, and recall specific versions later [...]"* ([Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs.html))
:::

::::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment}
{{< fa laptop-code >}} keep track of changes in a directory (a "repository")

{{< fa code-commit >}} take snapshots ("commits") of your repo at any time

{{< fa timeline >}} know the history: what was changed when by whom

{{< fa code-compare >}} compare commits and go back to any previous state

{{< fa code-pull-request >}} work on parallel "branches" & flexibly "merge" them

{{< fa upload >}} "push" your repo to a "remote" location & share it

{{< fa brands github >}} {{< fa brands gitlab >}} share repos on platforms like GitHub or GitLab

{{< fa people-group >}} work together on the same files at the same time

{{< fa pen-to-square >}} others can read, copy, edit and suggest changes

{{< fa box-open >}} make your repo public and openly share your work

## What is Git?

![[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)](../images/git-logo-full.svg){fig-align="center" width=50%}

- most popular version control system
- free, [open-source](https://github.com/git) command-line tool
- graphical user interfaces exist, e.g., [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- standard tool for most (all?) software developers
- 100 million [GitHub](https://github.com/) users ^[(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub))]

## More benefits of Git(Hub) for (teaching) project management {visibility="hidden"}

::: {.incremental}
- {{< fa bug >}} Discuss and plan your teaching preparation in [issues](https://github.com/features/issues) (even just with your future / past self)
- {{< fa comments >}}  Ask questions, share ideas and discuss with your community via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions)
- {{< fa code-pull-request >}} Propose changes to the teaching materials using [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) ^[*pull* requests on GitHub, *merge* requests on GitLab]
- {{< fa code-fork >}} Create a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of someone else's repository and extend their teaching materials
- {{< fa key >}} Manage access to your teaching materials with detailed [permissions and roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)
- {{< fa book-medical >}} Add documentation to your repository or in a separate [wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)
- {{< fa graduation-cap >}} Access to more features and tools for teaching via [GitHub Campus Global](https://education.github.com/)
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Note**

- {{< fa brands github >}} The dominance of GitHub (a for-profit company owned by Microsoft) is not uncontested (see [#GiveUpGitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/))
- {{< fa boxes-packing >}} A project on GitHub is not a FAIR archiving of scholarly outputs (see previous and following slides)
:::

::: {.notes}
- GitHub Copilot is a for-profit AI product trained with projects that were hosted on GitHub, including many that have licenses that require proper author attribution etc.
- GitHub has a for-profit software services contract with the USA Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
- Archiving on GitHub is not enough
