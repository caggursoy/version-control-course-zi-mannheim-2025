### Setup

1. Set your Git username and email address.
1. Change the default name of the initial "branch" to `main`.
1. :rocket: Optional: Change your default text editor.

### First steps with Git

1. Create a `recipes` folder and turn it into a Git repository.
1. Add a *short* recipe to `recipes.txt` (any favorite or an intriguing AI-generated one).
1. Stage and commit your changes to the repository.

### Basic Git workflow

1. Commit at least three additional changes in `recipes.txt`.
1. Create a `.gitignore` file
    - Everyone: Create a random file that you want to ignore, for example `random-file.docx`.
    - Add the random file to the `.gitignore` file, stage and commit your changes.
    - All macOS users: Let your repository ignore `.DS_Store`.
1. :rocket: Make at least one commit using `git commit --amend`.
    - For example, add a recipe without a title first, commit, then add a title and use `git commit --amend` to add the title change to the same commit.
1. :rocket: Optional: Commit `.gitkeep` in an otherwise empty directory

Note: There are several terms in these instructions that might still be unfamiliar to you, for example "repository", "stage" or "commit".
Don't worry, you will learn about what these terms mean in the chapters.
