### Navigation and setup

Identify a folder on your computer where you (want to) keep course-related files. 
If you don't have one, choose a suitable location in your file system.
**Navigate into the chosen location** using the command line.
Use the command line to **display the path** of your chosen directory.
What is the output?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

For folder navigation, use `cd`.
To display the contents of a folder, use `ls`.
To display the path of the current working directory, use `pwd`.

For example, on macOS if you navigated to the `Documents` folder and used `pwd`, the path looks like this:

```{zsh}
/Users/myusername/Documents
```

### Creating a folder and a file

Within your chosen folder, create a new subfolder and name it `recipes`.
Navigate into the `recipes` folder. 
**Create a new file** and name it `recipes.txt`.
**Confirm the creation of the file by listing the contents** of the `recipes` folder.
Which commands did you use?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

1. Create a folder called `recipes`:

```{zsh}
mkdir recipes
```

2. Navigate into the `recipes` folder:

```{zsh}
cd recipes
```

3. Create a file and name it `recipes.txt`:

```{zsh}
touch recipes.txt
```

4. List the contents of the `recipes` folder:

```{zsh}
ls
```

### Writing and opening files

**Add the title** "My Favorite Recipes" to `recipes.txt`.
Which command or method did you use?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

I added the title to `recipes.txt` by using the following command:

```{zsh}
echo "My Favorite Recipes" > recipes.txt
```

This command writes "My Favorite Recipes" to the file, overwriting any existing content.

:::

### Creating multiple files

Go back to your main course-related folder. 
Using the command line, **create three new files:** `notes.txt`, `assignments.txt`, and `schedule.txt`.
Provide the command you used.

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

```{zsh}
touch notes.txt assignments.txt schedule.txt
```

:::

### Wildcards

Use a wildcard pattern to **list all `.txt` files** in your folder.
Which command did you use?

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

```{zsh}
ls *.txt
```

:::

### Bonus question

Imagine, that you are in a folder containing multiple text files with various extensions, including `.txt`, `.md`, and `.docx`.
You want to move all the `.txt` files to a subfolder named "text_files" while keeping the other file types in the current directory.
Write a series of command-line commands to accomplish this task, including creating the "text_files" subdirectory.
Explain each step in your solution.

::: {.callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="true" appearance="simple"}

1. Creating the "text_files" subfolder:

```{zsh}
mkdir text_files
```

2. Moving all the `.txt` files to the "text_files" subfolder:

```{zsh}
mv *.txt text_files
```
