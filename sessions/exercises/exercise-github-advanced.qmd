### 1. Public collaboration with pull requests (using a "fork")

1. Find out what [forking](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-advanced.html) is
1. **Fork the recipes repository** of another course participant (ideally, someone who is *not* your partner from the previous exercise)
1. Create an **Issue**, suggesting a missing recipe
1. Create an Issue in your partner's repository (maybe their repository is missing a great recipe?)
1. Repeat the steps from the previous exercise using the forked repository:
    1. **Clone** the *forked* repository into a sensible location
    1. **Create a new branch** and create **one or multiple commits** "fixing" the Issue that you opened
    1. **Push** your changes to GitHub
    1. **Create a pull request** with your changes (hint: from the forked to the original repository) and refer to the Issue in your pull request

### 2. Review pull requests in your repository

1. View any pull requests that are created in your `recipes` repository.
1. Review the changes made by the contributor in the pull request.
1. If needed, discuss additional changes with the contributor in the pull request.
1. Close the pull request by merging the proposed changes.
    
### :rocket: Optional: Practice forking on GitHub

1. Repeat the entire forking workflow (see task 1 above) with [Lennart's `recipes` repository](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/recipes/).
Find out about the **contributing guidelines** in Lennart's repo and follow them when creating a new recipe.
