### 1. "Public" collaboration with pull requests (using a Fork)

1. Find out what [forking](https://lennartwittkuhn.com/version-control-book/chapters/github-advanced.html) is
1. **Fork the recipes repository** of another course participant (who is not your partner from the previous exercise)
1. Create an **issue**, suggesting a missing recipe
1. Create an issue in your partner's repository (maybe their repo is missing a great recipe?)
1. Repeat the steps from the previous exercise using the forked repository:
    1. **Clone** the *forked* repository into a sensible location
    1. **Create a new branch** and create **one or multiple commits** "fixing" the issue that you opened
    1. Follow the **contributing guide** in Lennart's repo to create a new recipe
    1. **Push** your changes to GitHub
    1. **Create a pull request** with your changes (hint: from the fork to the original repo) and refer to the issue in your pull request

### 2. Review pull requests in your repository

1. View any pull requests that are created in your `recipes` repository.
1. Review the changes made by the contributor in the pull request.
1. If needed, discuss additional changes with the contributor in the pull request.
1. Close the pull request by merging the proposed changes.
    
### :rocket: Optional: Practice forking on GitHub

1. Repeat the entire forking workflow (see task 1 above) with [Lennart's `recipes` repository](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/recipes/).
